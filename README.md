# Description:

This solution for the [frontend-mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0) challenge uses [Maplibre](https://maplibre.org/) to create maps instead of Leaflet, along with [ipapi](https://ipapi.co/) in place of Ipify. The frameworks used are [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
